**Step to follow** :

- Ask you the good questions about your commit :

- Why was the change needed?

- What are the changes in reference to?

- Add a type for your commit

- `feat` – a new feature is introduced with the changes

- `fix` – a bug fix has occurred

- `chore` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)

- `refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

- `docs` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files

- `style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.

- `test` – including new or correcting previous tests

- `perf` – performance improvements

- `ci` – continuous integration related

- `build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

- `revert` – reverts a previous commit

- Write your commit message : git commit

- `git commit -m "Feat: My commit message which explain in detail my changes"`
